# Inner West Creative Network

The Inner West Creative Network is an artist-run, not-for-profit organisation that seeks to provide Inner West artists and creatives with a mechanism for connecting with each other and opportunities to enhance the business aspects and sustainability of their practice.

The network hopes to promote and make visible the diverse range of Inner West artists, their art-making practices, and creations to audiences from far and wide and assist creatives by advocating ideas and needs to those who can provide support. The Inner West Creative Network gratefully acknowledges seed funding & start-up grants received from Inner West Council. 

[Our site](https://innerwestcreativenetwork.org.au/) is currently a work in progress. Various elements may not behave as expected, but like all passion-filled creative projects, we are diving in and will continue to improve it, and we will keep adding to the categories. If you encounter any issues or bugs, please [let us know](https://github.com/IWCN/.github/issues) so we can resolve them.
